```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/usps-tracking.git
   cd usps-tracking
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `config` folder using `.env.example` as a template with the following variables:
   ```env
   USPS_API_KEY=your_usps_api_key
   CLIENT_ID="Your USPS CLIENT ID"
   CLIENT_SECRET="Your USPS CLIENT SECRET"
   ```

## Usage
### Running the Application
Execute the following command to start the application:
```bash
go run usps.go
```

### Example Tracking Request
1. Ensure the USPS API key is set in the `.env` file.
2. Use the `tracking.go` module to fetch tracking details for a package.

### Sample Output
```json
{
  "trackingNumber": "9400111899560000000000",
  "status": "In Transit",
  "estimatedDelivery": "2024-12-25",
  "lastUpdate": "2024-12-18T10:30:00Z"
}
```
